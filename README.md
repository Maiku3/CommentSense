## Introduction
This project involves analyzing the sentiment expressed in comments on YouTube videos. The only sentiment indicator of the Youtube videos is the amount of likes as you can no longer view the amount of dislikes. Through the use of Machine Learning and Natural language processing, it is possible to analyze the sentiment of comments, which can provide more valuable insight into whether viewers like or dislike a video.

## Model
### Dataset
First, to train a model, a dataset of text with sentiment labels is needed. I used this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140), Sentiment140 from Kaggle to train the model. It is a dataset of 1.6 million tweets labeled as positive, neutral, or negative. It would have been ideal if I could find a dataset of YouTube comments as that is what we are analyzing.
